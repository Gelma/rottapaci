## What's up, doc?

Rottapaci is a quick&dirty way to detect PHP break in.
It keeps an eye on what happens in the Apache DocumentRoot of your site.
If a suspicious file appears, it complains.

### Long story
When a file is created/moved in your site Apache DocumentRoot, it:
* checks white list filename (for files to ignore by name)
* checks file type (via file utility)
* checks if is a good known file
* if there something like a C file, it shouts via mail, chat, web, syslog
